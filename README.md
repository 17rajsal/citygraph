## 📌 Overview

Modern cities are interconnected systems. A failure in one infrastructure sector can affect other sectors through shared dependencies.

For example:

- Drainage pump stations may become overloaded during heavy rainfall.
- Floodwater may affect roads and underpasses.
- Damaged roads may reduce access to hospitals and emergency services.
- Power failures may increase the risk of secondary infrastructure failures.

**CityGraph** models these dependencies as a graph and provides an interactive environment for exploring infrastructure risks, flood scenarios, and emergency routes.

The platform combines:

- Graph theory
- Cascading-failure simulation
- GIS-based visualization
- Historical event replay
- Risk-weighted route planning
- Interactive infrastructure inspection

> **Important:** CityGraph is an educational and research-oriented prototype. It is not a live emergency-management system.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional emergency dashboards often display maps, charts, or isolated sensor information. They may not clearly show how a failure in one infrastructure sector can affect another connected sector.

CityGraph addresses this problem by combining graph-based infrastructure modeling, spatial visualization, and simulated failure propagation in one interactive platform.

The project focuses on helping users explore:

- Infrastructure dependencies
- Potential cascading failures
- Flood-affected corridors
- Asset-level risk
- Emergency route alternatives
- Historical flood scenarios

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Synthetic Delhi Infrastructure Network

The project includes a synthetic urban infrastructure graph containing:

- Hospitals and trauma-care facilities
- Fire dispatch headquarters
- Stormwater pumping stations
- Power substations
- Arterial road corridors
- Interconnected infrastructure dependencies

The simulation demonstrates how stress in one infrastructure sector can propagate through connected assets.

#### Main capabilities

- Graph-based infrastructure representation
- Heavy-rainfall stress simulation
- Cascading-failure propagation
- Asset-level diagnostics
- Failure-reason display
- Capacity and risk inspection
- Connected-road analysis
- Risk-weighted emergency routing

The route solver uses graph-based shortest-path calculations to identify corridors that avoid simulated failures.

### 2. Delhi Historical Flood Replay

This module provides a historical reference replay based on the July 2023 Yamuna flood event in Delhi.

Features include:

- Chronological flood-event timeline
- Historical water-level visualization
- Flood-affected area overlays
- Road-status visualization
- GeoJSON-based flood layers
- Historical route analysis
- Interactive GIS map

The module demonstrates how historical flood information can be explored through a visual and interactive interface.

> **HISTORICAL REFERENCE DATA — NOT FOR LIVE EMERGENCY USE**

The flood layers and road classifications are reconstructed for demonstration and should not be treated as real-time operational data.

---

### 3. Nepal Flash-Flood Reference Scenario

CityGraph also includes a simulated mountain-valley scenario representing flash-flood conditions in steep terrain.

The scenario includes:

- Valley-floor infrastructure
- Mid-slope infrastructure
- High-ridge evacuation points
- Flooded river corridors
- Debris-flow road blockages
- Hydropower-related infrastructure
- Evacuation route visualization

The evacuation route demonstrates movement from lower-elevation areas toward safer elevated locations.

> **SIMULATED REFERENCE MODEL — NOT AN OFFICIAL OR LIVE MONITORING FEED**

This scenario is illustrative and does not represent live conditions or precise survey data for a specific Himalayan location.

---

### 4. Interactive Visualizations

The frontend provides multiple visualization modes:

- Cytoscape.js network graph
- Leaflet GIS map
- Historical flood timeline
- Custom SVG mountain-valley visualization
- Asset diagnostic panels
- Risk and failure indicators
- Route overlays

These visualizations help users understand infrastructure dependencies and simulated emergency conditions.

---

### 5. Authentication and Session Management

The application includes a local authentication flow using:

- JWT bearer tokens
- Password hashing
- SQLite database
- Protected API routes
- User registration and login
- Current-user profile endpoint

The authentication system is intended for local development and demonstration.

> **Security note:** Configure strong secrets and production-grade authentication before deploying the application publicly.
